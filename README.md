# Coffee Hours

**Deeper Connections made easy.**

Virtual coffee chats are one of the most powerful networking tools out there, especially during these times of remote work and limited socialization. Although platforms like LinkedIn  exist, they are solely professional, achievement-oriented and their target audience lie just beyond young adults. 

Coffee Hours is a youth-friendly website used for facilitating virtual coffee chats with current students, faculty members and alumni from universities across Canada. This is a platform for students where genuine interest to learn about others and their experiences is cultivated, rather than being consumed by the culture of networking for the "sake of getting a job or into the most popular university program"
