        "As the first girl in my family of immigrants to pursue a degree, there have been no shortage of obstacles along the way. From dealing with losing family members to facing financial hardship, applying to my dream program for university was challenging enough. I didnâ€™t have any guidance from people that looked like me that I could look up to for help or simply reassurance. Though battling these mental barriers was incredibly difficult, as I tackled one challenge at a time, I was able to gain the confidence to be resilient. I worked hard and although didnâ€™t always get the results I hoped for, I began forming a community around me that became my unconditional support network. I realized I attracted the energy I gave to others, so I maintained my values and work ethic to get where I am today. Iâ€™d love to chat about my story and experience in hopes to being someone others can now look up to!",
