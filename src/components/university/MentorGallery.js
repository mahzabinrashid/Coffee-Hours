        "As the first girl in my family of immigrants to pursue a degree, there have been no shortage of obstacles along the way. From dealing with losing family members to facing financial hardship, applying to my dream program for university was challenging enough. I didnâ€™t have any guidance from people that looked like me that I could look up to for help or simply reassurance. Though battling these mental barriers was incredibly difficult, as I tackled one challenge at a time, I was able to gain the confidence to be resilient. I worked hard and although didnâ€™t always get the results I hoped for, I began forming a community around me that became my unconditional support network. I realized I attracted the energy I gave to others, so I maintained my values and work ethic to get where I am today. Iâ€™d love to chat about my story and experience in hopes to being someone others can now look up to!",

        "I was born without hands and feet. Itâ€™s a rare condition called congenital amputation. Living with that adversity has made me who I am today. My parents played a vital role in helping me persevere and appreciate myself more when I constantly compared my situation to everyone else's in the world. They're simple, but consistent words of affirmation helped me make peace with how I was going to have to live my life from now on. And my condition didn't stop me. I continued to have a blast in university and finish at the top of my honour role. I partook in every opportunity I wished in university - from a student exchange, to competing in debate competitions. I now work in my dream job no matter the limitations I had when I started. I'd love to talk about my experiences, book a chat if you'd like to learn more!",

        "Iâ€™m a sociology major by day, and an aspiring DJ by night and I love it. After constantly being let down by others as I'm not someone they 'expect' to have these interests, really put a toll on me since I felt restricted from something I loved to do solely because I looked a certain way. There came a point where I didn't even bother telling others that I liked to DJ because of the judgmental 'huhs?' I would get afterwards. Even if others didn't know, I kept creating and learning to DJ behind closed doors. Especially during the pandemic, I finally gained the confidence to share what I'd been creating with the rest of the world that helped me feel the pride and excitement I once felt pursuing my interests. After all these years, I've become a more self-driven person who is now prioritizing being her unconditional self in front of everyone she meets. Reach out to me if you'd like to learn more!",
